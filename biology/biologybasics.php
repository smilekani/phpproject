	  <h2>Biology Definition</h2>
	   <br><p class="normal">Biology is the natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms, including their physical and chemical structure, </p>
	   <br><p class="normal">function, development and evolution.[1] Modern biology is a vast field, composed of many branches. Despite the broad scope and the </p>
	   <br><p class="normal">complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field. In general, biology </p>
	   <br><p class="normal">recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the creation </p>
	   <br><p class="normal">of new species. It is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their </p>
	   <br><p class="normal">internal environment.</p>
