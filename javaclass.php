      <h3>Java Class</h3>
      <p>A class is a blueprint for an object.It tells the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) how to make object for a particular type.
	  For Example: All Human Beings are denoted commonly by certain properties such as name, place etc by a class named "HUMAN".
	  But No human object is made still now.The Human Beings are created as Object by assigning values to properties such as name,place etc 
	  withrespective to human class.
