      <h3>ARM processors</h3>
	<p>ARM processors are a family of 32-bit microprocessors developed by Advanced RISC Machines, Ltd. in the 1980s.
	Today ARM processors power a wide variety of electronic devices, including mobile phones, tablets, multimedia players and more. 
ARM processors are based on a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, and while they do share the low-end market with processors from 
AMD and Intel, they aren't designed to compete with these companies' higher-end processors.
